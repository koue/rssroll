    <title>Ant Tip 1: Write a master build file</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Many Java projects are divided into multiple subprojects or modules, each in its own directory. Often you&#8217;ll want to build
subprojects individually, without necessarily building all of the larger
master project. For example, in my XOM project, I have one master
build.xml file that builds the software itself, and another build.xml file in the web [...]]]></description>

    <title>CVS Tip 1: Checking out an Entire Sourceforge Project</title>
    <description><![CDATA[The usual SourceForge CVS instructions ask you to check out modules like so:

  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jedit login
  &#160;
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jedit co -P modulename

	Of course many projects are divided into multiple modules, all of
	which are required. You can check out the entire project, including
	all of its modules like this:


  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/project  login
  &#160;
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/project co .

That is, [...]]]></description>

    <title>Please Sir. Can I have some more XML?</title>
    <description><![CDATA[
Here&#8217;s some code I had to write this morning. This isn&#8217;t all of it, and it isn&#8217;t done yet:


set theTime to the time of theDate
set theHours to theTime / 3600 as integer
set theMinutes to ((theTime mod 3600) / 60) as integer
set theSeconds to theTime mod 60
if (theSeconds &#38;lt; 10) then
  set theSeconds to "0" &#38; theSeconds
end [...]]]></description>

    <title>Why Mokka mit Schlag?</title>
    <description><![CDATA[About a year ago I launched a The Cafes with some fanfare to host shorter writings on a variety of subjects that didn’t already fit
into Cafe au Lait or Cafe con Leche. That site was a partial response to
my feelings about the shortcomings of a lot of existing weblog
management and CMS software. [...]]]></description>

    <title>Don’t Confirm Me!</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Over the last few days I’ve been trying out quite a bit of new software as part of a couple of new projects. This includes the
Vienna RSS client, the WordPress blogging engine, and the PHPMyAdmin
web-based interface to MySQL. Along the way I’ve noticed the same
repeating problem in each of these products, and [...]]]></description>

    <title>Upgrade Instructions Considered Necessary</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Some thoughts on upgrading open source server software
Yesterday I spent a couple of hours avoiding real work by upgrading my
software. Specifically I upgraded MySQL 4.1, Apache 2, and PHP here on
cafe.elharo.com after noticing that MySQL had crashed. I didn&#8217;t do
any major version upgrades, just moved everything up to the latest point [...]]]></description>

    <title>Mad as Hell</title>
    <description><![CDATA[ I&#8217;m getting really tired of paying for software that doesn&#8217;t work and isn&#8217;t supported. It&#8217;s one thing when a free-beer tool like Thunderbird or Eclipse or doesn&#8217;t work quite right. It&#8217;s quite another when I&#8217;ve given some company my hard-earned cash, and they can&#8217;t bothered to fix bugs,  answer my e-mail, or support [...]]]></description>

    <title>Ant: A Case Study in How Not To Write An Error Message</title>
    <description><![CDATA[After I complained about about build failures in Ant 1.6 on Cafe au Lait, a couple of Ant developers wrote to me after I initially
posted the above with various suggestions and FAQ references. They were
nothing I hadn&#8217;t tried before though. However what really got my
goat about this whole situation was not the [...]]]></description>

    <title>Notes on the Santa Clara Convention Center/Westin Santa Clara</title>
    <description><![CDATA[ After five plus years of staying way too often at this particular complex, I decided to put down some notes for fellow
travelers who find themselves booked into this boring behemoth or nearby
locations, situated in the middle of gorgeous suburban Santa Clara, home
of office parks and strip malls. Believe it or not, [...]]]></description>

    <title>Comparing Strings For Equality</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Java&#8217;s slogan is &#8220;Write once, run anywhere&#8221;; but perhaps it should be, &#8220;Write once, run anywhere except Turkey.&#8221; Java is a wonderful programming language that&#8217;s loved and adored around the world, but not in Turkey, a nation of more than 60 million people. Nor is Java all that popular with the millions of Turkish speakers [...]]]></description>
